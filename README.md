Note: This project purposefully has no license and as such is closed sourced.  I had a ton of fun making this project, but am only allowed to keep it online if I keep it's url a secret.  I am keeping this here as a part of my personal portfolio, but do not wish it to be forked and will not accept pull requests.  In the unfortunate case that people find and use my site, I will take it down immediately. Yik Yak has recently released their own beta version of a desktop version, and their's is much better anyway. 

Desktop version of Yik Yak using djtech42 yikyak api. This api is old and outdated now, which is why many functions of the actual app won't work on this site.

Working:

    view yaks
  
    change locations
  
    vote on yaks/comments
  
    connect to phones user account
  
    search yaks
  
    peeking
  
Not working:

    comment icons
  
    posting yaks/comments
  
    Peeking at non-locations (Week in review, etc.)
